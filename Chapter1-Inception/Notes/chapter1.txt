///////////////// HTML <!DOCTYPE> DECLARATION /////////////////

As the name suggests, <!DOCTYPE> is used in HTML to specify the type of document. It is the first line of code and appears above the <html> tage.
    The <!DOCTYPE HTMLT> declaration is an instruction to the browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web
page is parsed in the same way by different browsers. 

///////////////// EMMET /////////////////

EMMET is a plugin for editors that allows for faster and more efficient HTML and CSS coding. It allows developers to write HTML and CSS code using 
Shorthand notation, which is then expanded into full code by the plugin.
    EMMET can be used with HTML by installing the plugin in a text editor and then using the shorthand elements, nesting elements, adding classes 
and IDs, adding attributes, and more.
    The main benefit of using Emmet with html is increased productivity and faster coding. Emmet also has lot of built-in snippets and other 
features that can help to speed up the development process.

///////////////// Library V/S Framework /////////////////

Developers often to use the terms "library" and "framework" interchangeably. But there is a difference.

Both frameworks and libraries are code written by someone else that is used to help solve common problems.

The technical difference between a framework and a library lies in a term called inversion of control.
    When you use a library, you're in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a 
framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as 
needed.

In summary
ðŸ‘‰ Framework and libraries are both code written by someone else that helps you perform some common tasks in a less verbose way.
ðŸ‘‰ A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A library doesn't. The programmer calls library where 
   and when they need it.
ðŸ‘‰ The degree of freedom a library or framework gives the developer will dictate how "opinionated" it is.
